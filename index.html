        <p>By now you've probably heard that protein is an important nutrient to eat every day. Putting a few high-protein dinners on your weekly menu is one great way to help make getting enough daily intake a little easier, no matter what else the day throws at you.</p>
        <p>Here are a list of our favourite dishes to help you get started on the Protein Based Diet journey</p>
        <a href="spicy-shrimp-spinach-caesar-salad.html">Spicy Shrimp Spinach Caesar Salad</a>
        <p>Homemade spicy Caesar dressing is the star of this salad—though the baked shrimp isn't too bad itself, either.</p>

        <a href="easy-salmon-piccata.html">Easy Salmon Piccatta</a>
        <p>If you already love chicken piccata—the briny, lemony, caper-packed Italian favorite—you'll be obsessed with this speedy salmon version.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="cheesy-chicken-enchilada-pasta.html">Cheesy Chicken Enchilada Pasta</a>
        <p>Who knew two perfect foods (enchiladas and pasta) could come together to make something even better? It's creamy. It's cheesy. It's full of protein.</p>
